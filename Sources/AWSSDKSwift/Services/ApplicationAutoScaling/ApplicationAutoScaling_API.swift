/**
With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for your scalable resources. You can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:   Define scaling policies to automatically scale your AWS or custom resources   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms   Schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions   View the history of your scaling events   Application Auto Scaling can scale the following resources:   Amazon ECS services. For more information, see Service Auto Scaling in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   Amazon EC2 Spot fleets. For more information, see Automatic Scaling for Spot Fleet in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.   Amazon EMR clusters. For more information, see Using Automatic Scaling in Amazon EMR in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.   AppStream 2.0 fleets. For more information, see Fleet Auto Scaling for Amazon AppStream 2.0 in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Developer Guide.   Provisioned read and write capacity for Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes. For more information, see Managing Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto Scaling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   Amazon Aurora Replicas. For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants. For more information, see Automatically Scaling Amazon SageMaker Models.   Custom resources provided by your own applications or services. More information is available in our GitHub repository.

    ///  Creates or updates a policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target using RegisterScalableTarget. To update a policy, specify its policy name and the parameters that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. You can view the scaling policies for a service namespace using DescribeScalingPolicies. If you are no longer using a scaling policy, you can delete it using DeleteScalingPolicy. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale in and scale out. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.
